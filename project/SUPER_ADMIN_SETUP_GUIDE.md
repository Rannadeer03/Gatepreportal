Apply both migration files to your Supabase project:

```sql
-- Run these in your Supabase SQL Editor in order:
-- 1. Main super admin system
-- File: project/supabase/migrations/20250802000000_create_super_admin_system.sql

-- 2. Default super admin account
-- File: project/supabase/migrations/20250802000001_create_default_super_admin.sql
```

### Step 2: Login with Default Credentials
1. **Go to Login Page**: Navigate to `/login`
2. **Enter Credentials**:
   - Email: `superadmin@gatepreportal.com`
   - Password: `SuperAdmin123!`
3. **Login**: Click login button

### Step 3: Access Super Admin Portal
1. **Automatic Redirect**: You'll be redirected to `/super-admin-dashboard`
2. **Change Password**: Go to Settings and change the default password immediately
3. **Start Managing**: Begin approving users and managing the system

   - Save the changes

#### Option 2: Upgrade Existing Account
If you already have an account in the system:

```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
-- Replace 'your-email@example.com' with your actual email
UPDATE profiles
SET
  role = 'super_admin',
  approval_status = 'approved',
  approved_at = NOW()
WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

### Method B: Using Supabase Dashboard (GUI)

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Sign in to your project

2. **Navigate to Table Editor**
   - Click on "Table Editor" in the left sidebar
   - Select the "profiles" table

3. **Find Your Account**

   - Change `role` to: `super_admin`
   - Change `approval_status` to: `approved`
   - Set `approved_at` to current timestamp
   - Click "Save"

### Method C: Using SQL Commands

```sql
-- Method 2A: Create completely new super admin
INSERT INTO auth.users (
  id,
  email,
  encrypted_password,
  email_confirmed_at,
  created_at,
  updated_at
) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  'admin@yourcompany.com',
  crypt('your-secure-password', gen_salt('bf')),
  NOW(),
  NOW(),
  NOW()
);

-- Then create the profile
INSERT INTO profiles (
  id,
  name,
  email,
  role,
  approval_status,
  approved_at,
  auth_provider
) VALUES (
  (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'admin@yourcompany.com'),
  'Super Administrator',
  'admin@yourcompany.com',
  'super_admin',
  'approved',
  NOW(),
  'email'
);
```

```sql
-- Method 2B: Upgrade existing user
UPDATE profiles 
SET 
  role = 'super_admin',
  approval_status = 'approved',
  approved_at = NOW(),
  approved_by = id  -- Self-approved for initial setup
WHERE email = 'your-existing-email@example.com';
```

### Method D: Using Supabase CLI

If you have Supabase CLI installed:

```bash
# Connect to your project
supabase login
supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref

# Run SQL command
supabase db reset
# Then apply the migration and run the SQL commands above
```
