# Super Admin Portal Implementation

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation of the Super Admin Portal with user approval system and activity logging.

## üéØ Overview

The Super Admin Portal provides centralized user management, approval workflows, and system monitoring capabilities. Key features include:

- **Student Registration Approval**: Students register but require super admin approval
- **Teacher Management**: Only super admins can create teacher accounts
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All user activities are tracked and monitored
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Secure access controls for different user roles

## üìã Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **User Approval System**: Added approval status fields to profiles table
- **System Logging**: Created comprehensive activity logging table
- **Super Admin Role**: Extended role system to include super_admin
- **Database Functions**: Created stored procedures for user approval and logging

### 2. User Registration Flow
- **Student-Only Registration**: Public registration limited to students only
- **Pending Approval Status**: New students start with 'pending' approval status
- **Email Notifications**: Users notified about approval status changes
- **Teacher Removal**: Removed teacher registration from public forms

### 3. Super Admin Dashboard
- **User Management**: View and manage all system users
- **Pending Approvals**: Review and approve/reject student registrations
- **Teacher Creation**: Create new teacher accounts with full details
- **Activity Monitoring**: Real-time system activity logs
- **Statistics Overview**: Dashboard with key metrics and insights

### 4. Authentication & Security
- **Approval Status Checking**: Login blocked for pending/rejected users
- **Role-Based Access**: Different access levels for different roles
- **Activity Logging**: All login attempts and user actions logged

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Changes

#### Profiles Table Updates
```sql
-- Add approval fields
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN approval_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending';
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN approved_by UUID REFERENCES profiles(id);
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN approved_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN rejection_reason TEXT;

-- Add super_admin role
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD CONSTRAINT profiles_role_check 
CHECK (role IN ('student', 'teacher', 'admin', 'super_admin'));
```

#### System Logs Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE system_logs (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  action_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  action_details JSONB,
  ip_address INET,
  user_agent TEXT,
  session_id TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Key Functions

#### User Approval Function
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION approve_user(
  p_user_id UUID,
  p_approved_by UUID,
  p_approval_status TEXT,
  p_rejection_reason TEXT DEFAULT NULL
) RETURNS BOOLEAN
```

#### Activity Logging Function
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION log_user_activity(
  p_user_id UUID,
  p_action_type TEXT,
  p_action_details JSONB DEFAULT NULL,
  p_ip_address INET DEFAULT NULL,
  p_user_agent TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  p_session_id TEXT DEFAULT NULL
) RETURNS UUID
```

### Service Layer Architecture
